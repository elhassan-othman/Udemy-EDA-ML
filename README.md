# About the Data

This dataset contains 3,682 records of courses from 4 subjects (Business Finance, Graphic Design, Musical Instruments, and Web Design) taken from Udemy. Udemy is a massive online open course (MOOC) platform that offers both free and paid courses. Anyone can create a course, a business model that has allowed Udemy to have hundreds of thousands of courses.

This version modifies column names, removes empty columns, and aggregates everything into a single CSV file for ease of use.

Here are some of the questions you can explore with this dataset:

* What are the most popular subjects on Udemy?
* What is the average price of a course?
* How many courses are offered by each instructor?
* What is the relationship between price and rating?
* What are the most common keywords used in course titles?

I hope this helps!
